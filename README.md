As part of my journey to master Java and strengthen my fundamentals in Object-Oriented Programming, I created a mini project called "Methodcalling" that covers multiple real-world inspired examples using classes, methods, and objects.

🧠 What I Did:

1️⃣ program/programApp

✅ Created a Java class named program with three basic methods:

start() – Prints “Program started”

restarted() – Prints “Program restarted”

stop() – Prints “Program stopped”

✅ In programApp, I created an object and called all three methods in sequence to simulate a program’s lifecycle.

🎯 Learned: Class & Method creation, object behavior, and modular coding!

2️⃣ Mobile/MobileApp
We built a Mobile class – almost like a student profile system:

📝 Attributes:

Mobile Name: "pixel"

Mobile Color: "gray"

⚙️ Methods:

call() → Simulates a call

mail() → Simulates a mail

📌 Practiced: ✔ Class & Object Creation
✔ Field Access
✔ Method Invocation

3️⃣ Human/HumanApp
Meet Harish – a virtual human doing his daily routine 😄

👨‍💼 Attributes:

Name: Harish

🎬 Methods:

eat() 🍽️

sleep() 😴

dancing() 💃

movie() 🎥

📚 Concepts Covered: ✔ Real-life object simulation
✔ Java Syntax
✔ OOPs for Beginners

4️⃣ Girlfriend/GirlfriendApp
To make OOP fun and relatable, I created a Girlfriend class 😊

🎀 Attributes:

Name: Priya

Height: 5.2 ft

Weight: 70.2 kg

Phone: 1234567890

🍽️ eat() & 😴 sleep() methods simulate behaviors.

🧠 Learning: ✔ Blueprint → Object
✔ Accessing data/behavior via instance
✔ Mapping real-world logic to Java

5️⃣ Car/CarApp
A real-world simulation 🚗 where:

Start() ➤ Car starts

Shiftgear() ➤ Gear shifts

move() ➤ Calls both methods to simulate motion

🎯 Skills Practiced: ✔ Method Calling
✔ Nested Method Calls
✔ Object Creation & Use
✔ Structure and Reusability

💬 It’s been a fantastic journey building these programs and slowly building my logic and coding confidence.
Next up: User input, constructors, and maybe even inheritance! 🚀
